# NCC Development Index

These memos describe the development, and eventual demise, of Exec-III for the PDP-1 for the ARPANet.

## Subjects:

- "NCC, ARPA Network Usage Accountring, ARPA Network System Programming, PDP-1D, etc."-Descibes adding the PDP-1D as a part of the network in conjuction with BBN'S TENEX machine.

- "Network Reliability"-Says on tin.

- "PDP-1 Interface to the Network"-Discusses using the PDP-1 to PDP-7 interface that was used for TELCOMP as a network interface.

- "PDP-1D"-No, they are not moving that PDP-10.  They may get rid of the PDP-7, though.

- "PDP-1 Interface to the Network"-Paper description of the interfaces and a handrawn schematic.

- "PDP-1 Incremental Dump"-*Always* make backups.  Discusses the procedures of doing so on the 1D.

- "IMP-PDP-1 Interface"-  A different proposal to hook the PDP-1 to an IMP.  Has schematics.

- "PDP-1 Software for the Net Handler"-Describes the software to communicate on the ARPANet.

- "User Communication Between the PDP-1d and the Network"-On how to trick a dedicated interface into a multiplexed interface by using the SYSNET handler.

- "New PDP-1 EXEC"-Rewrite of the net code.

- "MGEN"-First 100 message sent over 30 links.

- "PDP-1 User Interface to the Network (to Walden, et al.)"-Cossell's thoughts on it and the needs to handle flexibility and availability of the IMP.

- "PDP-1 User Interface to the Network (to the IMP Guys)"-More discussion on how to handle message queues.

- "Skeleton for an NCP for the PDP-1"-Describes failsafes and how it should talk to the world.

- "Network Programs on the PDP-1d"-Programs that will communicate to the TIP on an IMP.

- "Division use of TENEX--1"-They have FORTRAN on TENEX.  Discusses the pros and cons of using the PDP-1 over the PDP-10.

- "PDP-1d Network Handler"-More SYSNET development and bugs.

- "TIPLOADH on the PDP-1d"-A brand new TIP loader for the PDP-1d.

- "Division 6 Use of Tenex--2"-More stuff on TENEX.

- "PDP-1d Usage"-More errata about conversions and why to stick to the PDP-1d.  This includes keeping the PDP-1d for development.

- "IMP Verification"-Explains IMPVER's and associated programs' operation.

- "Division 6 Use of TENEX -- 3"-More stuff about TENEX advantages, bad security, and nmore users could possibly stress TENEX.

- "PDP-1 versus TENEX"-They need two timesharing systems.
